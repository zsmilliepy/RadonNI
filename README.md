Radon Distribution in Northern Ireland -  A Geological Perspective

This repository contains scripts and data files related to the radon potential classes in Northern Ireland. The data are sourced from Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI, 2021), the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA, 2015) and the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland (OSNI, 2020).
The aim of the script is to understand the geographical distribution of the radon potential levels in Northern Ireland and their connection to the geological and topographical features in the area.
